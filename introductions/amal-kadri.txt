Hey, I'm Amal Kadri
I got into economics almost by chance, through my interest in
political activism and public policy. I ended up really falling
in love with the power of data in general, and made it my goal
to learn to be as well equipped as I could be to answer the 
questions I had about the world with data. I'm honestly kind of 
a neophyte when it comes to coding, so I'm looking forward to
this semester's rigors so that I can round out my skillset.
